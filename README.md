# IsKPeriodic
                  Skillfactory C++ 12.7 home work: IsKPeriodic function realisation. 
           
                  Checks, wheather a string is k-periodic or not.
                  Algorithm splits the input string into two halves and compares them
                  every time until one halve becomes k-length. At the end it compares
                  the rest substring with the k-length prefix of the input string.
